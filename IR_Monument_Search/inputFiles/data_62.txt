The tomb of Mariam-uz-Zamani is the resting place of Jodha Bai, the favorite wife of Mughal Emperor Akbar. She gave birth to Jahangir, the next Mughal Emperor, which is why she was given the title of Mariam-uz-Zamani (Mary of the Age). The tomb is significant as it is quite magnificent in its own way. It is in the town of Sikandra that was built by Sikandar Lodi.
